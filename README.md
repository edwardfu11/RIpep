# RIpep
Peptide prediction from retained introns by reading in frame from prior exon at gene coding regions
This is a R script to predict the translated peptide sequences from interested introns (e.g., retained introns derived from RNA-seq analysis). The peptide sequence reads in frame from the prior exon at the coding gene regions.
